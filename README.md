## What Does It Do
* A page that displays a group of users (displayed via robots) with a search bar that can filter users when typed in
* User data is hard coded in to the project

## Why Did I Make It
* Get familiar with using multiple components in React to create user cards and a searchbox
* Create a search list that filters results in real time as the user types
* Pull user data into a fully built UI

## Tech I Used
* JavaScript
* React
* HTML/CSS
